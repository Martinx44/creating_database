# the-Super-store-
i was able to create a table for a super store using SSMS.
which i later visualised the data with tabeleau and microsoft power bi.
created graphs and charts to help me better understand the information in the data and see how the store is losing money based on different factors.
i beleive that my analysis will help the store make better decisions.
